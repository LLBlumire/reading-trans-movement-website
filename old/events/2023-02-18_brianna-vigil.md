### Notable Persons

Brianna Ghey was a 16-year-old girl from Warrington. She was described by her
family as a larger than life character who would leave a lasting impression on
all that met her. Beautiful, witty, hilarious, strong, and fearless. She was
bullied and attacked for years because of her gender identity. Her school, and
others in a position of power, did nothing to resolve the bullying. She was
murdered in a targeted attack by two teens of a similar age on the 11th of
February, 2023.

### UK Media and Government Response

The UK medias response to her death was abhorrent. Many publications
misgendered her and a few published her [dead name](/misc/deadname). The
times removed the word 'girl' from their article about her death, replacing it
with 'teen' after they learned she was trans. Many publications performed
similar acts of disrespect.

Due to the UKs regressive gender recognition laws, Brianna was unable to attain
a gender recognition certificate due to her age. Because of this, her death
certificate will misgender her as a final insult at the hands of the state. The
conservative government responded to public outcry allow a posthumous gender
recognition certificate to be issued by stating that the existing system was
working as intended, and that there were no plans to change it.

To clarify for those unaware, a gender recognition certificate allows a trans
person to update their gender marker on their birth, marriage, and death
certificates. That is its only function, despite [trans genocide
advocates](/misc/tga) frequently spreading misinformation about the impacts of
the certficiate. Scotland attempted to lower the age it could be acquired to
16, in line with their minimum age for marriage, and was blocked by the UK
government. In truth, there should be no age limit on acquisition &mdash; as
Brianna has sadly shown, a death certificate can be required at any age.

### Vigil At Forbury Gardens

While few outside her local area and social circle knew of Brianna before her
death, it shook the trans community in the UK to its core. Vigils were quickly
organised across the country, and Reading Trans Movement organised one to be
held in Forbury Gardens.

The vigil provided support for the local community in their grief and fear, and
allowed us to come together to share speeches, poetry, and songs in dedication
to Brianna.

Over 200 members of the local community attended the Vigil, and speakers
included representatives from Reading Trans Movement, as well as [Reading
Pride's My Umbrella][myum], [Trans in the City][titc], [Wokingham
Pride][wpride] (also representing the [Wokingham Liberal Democrats][wld] and
[Wokingham Borough Council][wbc]), [Support U][spu], [Reading University
Student Union][rusu], [Reading Minster Church][rmc], and [Reading Labour][rl].

[Reading pride recorded and uploaded footage of a portion of the
event][vigilvid], including speeches from many of the representatives listed
above, photos of tributes placed by the lion statue, and a recording of a
beautiful rendition of Scarecrow by Melissa Etheridge sung by one of the
attendants. The song was written about the kidnapping, torture, and murder of
21 year old Matthew Shepard motivated by the anti-gay movement of the 1990s.
