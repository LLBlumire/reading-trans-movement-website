## "Trans Genocide Advocate"?

This website uses the term "trans genocide advocate" to refer to vocal
proponents of views and ideas which if implemented would:

 - Deny trans or gender non-conforming people access to public spaces.
 - Deny trans or gender non-conforming people access to medication.
 - Forcibly detransition any trans or gender non-conforming person.
 - Limit trans or gender non-conforming peoples participation in public life.
 - Require public displays of a trans or gender non-conforming persons identity.
 - Increase the rate of suicide for trans or gender non-conforming people.
 - Actively seek to cause harm to trans or gender non-conforming people.
 - Promote the dehumanisation of trans or gender non-conforming people.

Those who hold these views frequently change what they refer to themselves as,
in order to best draw public support through misdirection of the consequences
of their views. They have previously been known as:

 - [Nazis][ifs]
 - Trans Exclusive Radical Feminists (TERFs)
 - Gender Critical Persons (GCs)
 - [Nazis][kjk]
