## Protesting Against Holly Lawford-Smith Advocating For The Torture Of Trans People At The University Of Reading

### Notable Persons

Holly Lawford-Smith is a well-known [trans genocide advocate][tga]. She
operates the website "No Conflict, They Said", which attempts to denigrate
trans people by presenting unverified stories about their alleged actions.
These stories are typically presented without context or proof and are filled
with hateful rhetoric. This website was denounced by a large number of
academics at her institution at the time in an [open letter][ol].

Rosa Freedman is a less well-known trans genocide advocate. When a student
criticized her for promoting anti-transgender views in her lectures, she leaked
the student's identity and contact information to the Daily Mail. This was an
attempt to propagate hate towards the student and reinforce the popular
rhetoric of "academics being suppressed by the woke mob."

### "Who Put The 'GI' in SOGI"

Holly Lawford-Smith was invited by Rosa Freedman to give a talk entitled "Who
Put The 'GI' in SOGI" at the [University of Reading][uni]. Although the title
of the talk appeared harmless, its content was an evaluation of the merging of
gender identity (GI) and sexual orientation (SO) regarding the prohibition of
conversion therapy.

During the talk, it was argued that the two should be treated separately and
that bans on conversion therapy should only pertain to sexual orientation. By
advocating for this viewpoint, Holly Lawford-Smith was endorsing the
[torture][untorture] of trans people.

Five of Holly Lawford-Smith and Rosa Freedman's acquaintances, who were not
students, attended the talk. Although four students were present in the room,
two of them were sent on behalf of the Reading Trans Movement to monitor the
discussion. The other two students reached out to us after the lecture to
verify that they only attended to gain a better understanding of what to
include in their complaints to the university about the talk.

In addition to promoting torture, Holly Lawford-Smith consistently misgendered
trans people throughout the talk. Furthermore, she referred to cisgender
self-identified lesbians in relationships with trans women as "heterosexual."

Attendance at the talk also necessitated that students email Rosa Freedman in
advance, which many found uncomfortable due to her previous behavior of
disclosing student contact information in the Daily Mail. Additionally,
students were required to present identification at the door to gain entry.
This made the talk significantly more exclusive and private than is typical at
the university.

### Protest

In response to the talk, the Reading Trans Movement was formed over the course
of two days and organized a demonstration outside the building where the talk
was taking place. The protest was highly successful, with over 100 attendees
throughout the day.

The protest was peaceful and laid-back in nature. University students, alumni,
and community members who were not affiliated with the university gathered to
hold signs and have a large picnic while advocating against the torture of
trans people.

### Open Letter

After hearing from students in attendance what was said, an open letter to the
Vice-Chancellor of the University of Reading was written, which can be [found
here](/files/Trans_Vigil_Letter.pdf).

The letter outlines the numerous shortcomings of the University in its handling
of the event and demands that the university take various measures to address
these shortcomings.

The Vice-Chancellor responded by failing to address any of the criticisms
raised in the letter. Additionally, the Vice-Chancellor misrepresented a
gathering of seven trans genocide advocates who were discussing the torture of
trans people as a place where honest discussion and debate occurred.

You can find the Vice-Chancellor's response [here][vc].
