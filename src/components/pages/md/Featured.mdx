## Pride Month Flags

For the month of June, we are encouraging businesses around Reading to hang
the Trans Pride, Non Binary Pride, or Progress Pride flag! We want Reading to.
show the world what a welcoming place it is to our community, and push back
against the tide of stochastic terrorism that is surpressing pride this year
through threats of violence.
