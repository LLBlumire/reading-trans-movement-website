**March for Transgender Day Of Visibility on Saturday the 1st of April 2023**

Reading Trans Movement is organising a march for the
[International Trans Day of Visibility][tdov].

Gather outside Metro Bank at the westernmost end of Broad St from 2:00pm. The
march will follow down broadstreet, then up to Forbury Gardens, where speakers
will present their speeches to the crowd. The march should be done by 3:30pm,
though we cannot predict how many will want to speak and how long they will
speak for.
