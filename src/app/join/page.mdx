# Join Us

We'd be delighted for you to join us and help out! [As we do not have a legal
entity][legal], all you need to do to participate in Reading Trans Movement is:

- Attend or help with a campaign organised by those affiliated with Reading
  Trans Movement.
- Consider yourself in good faith a member of Reading Trans Movement.

You do not need to be trans or gender non-conforming to participate. Allies are
not just welcome but are encouraged to participate: cis people clearly standing
in solidarity with trans people has not been needed as much as it is now for a
very long time.

The main place we organise is on a Discord server. Unfortunately due to hate
raids we received after being mentioned by prominent [trans genocide
advocates][tga], our Discord is not publicly accessible. You will need to find
someone who is already on the Discord to vouch for and invite you. These people
should be easy to find at any Reading Trans Movement event, and frequently
members of our technology working group will publicly ask at such events if
anyone would like to join.

On that topic, several [working groups][wg] exist within Reading Trans Movement.
These form the organisational heart of the movement. Each working group is able
to determine it's own method of adding new members, if you would like to get
involved in one of these then keep an eye out on the Discord (once you have
access) for calls for participation.
