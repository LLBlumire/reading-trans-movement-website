# Welcome To The Reading Trans Movement

Reading Trans Movement is an activist group in [Reading][rdg]. Founded to
support the local trans and gender non-conforming community, and to oppose any
who would advocate for the torture and genocide of our community.

The group initially came together over the span of two days to oppose a talk
held at the [University of Reading][uor] which argued in favour of the torture
of trans people. You can learn more about the [circumstances of the groups
founding here][founding].
