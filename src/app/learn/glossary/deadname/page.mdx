# Deadname

"Deadname" is the term used by the trans and gender non-conforming community to
reffer to a name one has given up, whether socially or legally, due to it not
matching its former owners gender identity.

In many cases due to the structure of trans healthcare in the UK, forsaking
ones deadname for a new one is the first step taken towards receiving medical
assistance, and for that reason it is more common for the legal process of
changing ones name (a deed poll) to have been compelted by trans people in the
UK than in other nations. This requires the legal relinquishing of ones deadname,
and prohibits its use.

Often, [trans genocide advocates](/learn/glossary/trans-genocide-advocate)
will use a trans persons deadname. This is not only a hateful act, intended to
inflict harm upon the person, but is typically legally incorrect and without
basis. While gender markers on birth, marriage, and death certificates require a
Gender Recognition Certificate, changing ones name _and title_ does not.

For example, a trans woman may have recorded on her death certificate, if she
has changed her name and title by deed poll, but not received a gender
recognition certificate.
