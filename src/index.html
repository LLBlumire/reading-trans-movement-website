        <p>
        The Reading Trans Movement is an activist group operating in the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire">Reading</a>
        area.
        </p>

                    Founding Protest Against Holly Lawford-Smith and Rosa
                    Freedman
                </h3>
            </summary>
            <p>
                The group was founded on the 23rd of April 2022 by
                <a href="/org/milan">Milan</a>, to organise a protest against
                a talk being given by
                <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDbh6iO9bYvStZyeiI4We5Z9EgxEfk1UhvjtO1zJyMI?usp=sharing">
                    notorious transphobe Holly Lawford-Smith</a>, and hosted by
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210629095911/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9736211/Professor-shares-letter-Reading-student-warning-gender-critical-talks-problematic.html">
                    Rosa Freedman, who had previously doxxed a student
                    criticising her transphobia in the Daily mail</a>. The talk,
                entitled &ldquo;Who Put the &lsquo;GI&rsquo; in
                SOGI&rdquo;, argued that it was incorrect for gender identity
                and sexual orientation to be considered together when nations
                implement bans on harmful conversion therapy practice. Following
                from this separation, the talk advocated that only conversion
                therapy applied to sexual orientation should be banned, thus
                advocating it is correct for
                <a href="http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=A/HRC/44/53&Lang=E">
                    transgender people to be subjected to torture</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Organisation began two days before the event, and rapidly spread
                from the student body into alumni and other local members of the
                trans, gender non-conforming, and allied community. Two days
                later, as the talk was going on,
                <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2022/04/28/university-of-reading-trans-conversion-therapy-holly-lawford-smith/">
                    over 100 people gathered with signs and flags</a>,
                protesting the talk. It is our belief that a total of 9
                people attended the talks, two of which were students explicitly
                sent into the talk by Reading Trans Movement to monitor the talk
                for any content which would break the university of readings
                guidelines against hate speech. Two other men in the audience
                later identified themselves to Reading Trans Movement as
                students only in attendance to build a full understanding of
                what was said in the talk to better raise their own complaints
                about it with the university. Bringing the total number in
                attendance of the talk to 5, all of whom appear to be personal
                friends of Rosa Freedman and Holly Lawford-Smith, and
                <a href="images/social-terfs.png">
                    went out with the two after the talk for a social
                    gathering</a>.

                <h3>Open Letter To The University Of Reading</h3>
            </summary>
            <p>
                In parallel with the protest, an open letter was drafted and
                collaborated on by many members of the movement, and eventually
                was published online in several formats.
                <a href="files/Trans_Vigil_Letter.pdf">
                    The letter</a> called for the University of Reading to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Assess the numerous breaches of the universities policies
                    which occured both in the content and presentation of the
                    talk.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Perform due dilegence when inviting future guest speakers
                    to the university, taking into account previous controversy
                    surrounding speakers and hosts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Publicly reaffirm its commitment to the rights of all
                    individuals, including transgender and gender non-conforming
                    people, to experience their university life in a safe
                    manner, free from discrimination and harrassment.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The university of reading failed to adequately responded to the
                issues raised in the open letter regarding safe accessibility
                to the lecture, the history of Holly Lawford-Smith and Rosa
                Freedman in presenting harmful and hateful rhetoric. In short
                <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/news/-/media/news/files/holly-lawfordsmith-seminar--reportfinal.pdf">
                    the university investigated itself, and found no
                    wrongdoing</a>. In companion to this, this vice chancellor 
                <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/news/2022/University-News/VC-comment-strengthen-freedom-and-support">
                    released a statement</a> which also addressed none of the
                concerns raised.

                gardens, and provided a space for grief and community to the
