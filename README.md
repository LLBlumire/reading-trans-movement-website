The simplest way to contribute is to write a `.md` file and send it on the
private discord. You can learn how to write these at https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/.

If you would like to help as a developer, either install `yarn`, or follow the
steps on https://zero-to-nix.com/ to have use the automatic developer
environment. Then run `yarn && yarn dev` to start a local development server.

Pull requests welcome.
